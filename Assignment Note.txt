EnterpriseWeb_Assignment1
Basic Point of Interest db using Mongo

in the assignment there are two types of people,

users: these are the general public
admin: these can edit and delete points of interest created by users.

In the assignment, there are two versions on the menu, depending on wheter you are a user or admin. when logged in as an admin person , can sign up up another admin person.

in the in the view points, you have the option of edit and delete.
if logged in as a user, the only option is view on the view points tab.
userlistings menu item allow you to edit the settings of any user and delete any user
settings only shows the curent logged in user


at this moment in time 
i cannot get the return url from the cloudinary upload as it throws an error.
i used the handlebars helpers to decide on what menu to display,cannot get it to work properly
whether you enter through the Admin or User Login, you get the same top menu.
however in the partial categoryList, the helper class works- 
 it displays the view option on each item for a user
 and for a admin, it displays the edit and delete otions
gallery is a cloudinary items, which works but at the time of this you need to manually enter the credentials stored in the .env file #add Point of interest, allows user or admin to add a point of interest
heroku site has issues and is not avaialble.
Sorry about the quality of the project, spent alot of time on the assignment, 
but not much to show for it.

Kind Regards Martin
